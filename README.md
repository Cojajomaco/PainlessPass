# PainlessPass
PainlessPass is a simple way to store your account credentials. Developed with security in mind, PainlessPass ensures that you, and only **_you_** can access your stored credentials. PainlessPass allows you to store and search through your credentials with ease. PainlessPass is open-source and dockerized, making it easy to run your own instance on your own hardware. 

## Installation
I'll figure this out soon, I guess. The goal is to pretty much have the app running with a few local commands to get Docker to do its thing. 

## Getting Started
Ideally, this would honestly be a simple command ran from the host directory:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

## License
PainlessPass uses the MIT license. Please read the LICENSE file for more details.
